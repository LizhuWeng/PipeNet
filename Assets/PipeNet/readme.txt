Once you have installed Pipe Net you should be able to see the PipeNet directory in your project view.
To start creating your new pipe network, click on GameObject > Create Other > PipeNet
This will place a new pipe network gameobject to the scene and create a horizontal plane for collision check when adding a new node(You can also delete that and then use your own colliders).
